-->Gradle is not a plugin that enables Flutter for Android; rather, it is an advanced build automation system used by Android, while Flutter uses its own integrated build tools that generate native Android code. [1, 2, 3]  
Here is a breakdown of their roles: 

• Gradle is a robust and flexible build system used primarily for Android app development. It automates the compilation, testing, and deployment of applications. When building an Android app, Gradle manages project dependencies, compiles source code and resources, and generates the final APK or AAB files. 
• Flutter is a UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. It uses its own command-line tools () to automate the build process across different platforms. [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]  

The connection between the two is that when you build a Flutter app for the Android platform, the Flutter build process actually calls upon the underlying Gradle system (specifically, the Gradle scripts within the  directory of your Flutter project) to manage the final native Android compilation steps. Flutter effectively orchestrates Gradle to produce the final Android application package. [9, 10, 11, 12]
